## :octocat: Projects

Here are some projects that I'm proud of 💪

- [Next NES 👾](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/next-nes)
  - My final project for computer engineering graduation, this is the project that I like the most. I picked that subject because I wasn't sure if I could do it, so when it was done, I was really glad.
- [:octocat: Pokedex React](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/pokedex_react_ts)
  - This project was my way to solve one of the challenges during my internship at **Crescer**. I implemented all the Pokeball effects as instructed, and it's incredible what you can do with CSS.
  - [Site](https://pokedex-react-ts.vercel.app/home)
- 🐍 SNAKE game lab view
  - I think that project showed that I'm really a developer. It's really bad that I don't have the source code ☹️.
- 🐍[Snake game C embedded](https://github.com/nicolaskruger/Snake)
  - First, I want to thank teacher Bruna for giving me the opportunity for my first internship at Unisinos.
  - I think that project is really cool.
